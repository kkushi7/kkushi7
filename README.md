My name is Kushi Kumbagowdana, and I am a new graduate student that just completed my bachelor's in Software Engineering at UCI. 
I am open to working in any field and have dabbled with both frontend and backend languages such as C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Python. 
ðŸŒ± I am currently challenging myself by taking an AI course to learn and gain a better understanding with APIs.
